# Illandril's Tidy Module Settings

This is a module for Foundry Virtual Tabletop that adjusts the Module Settings to be a little more usable by making each module's settings group collapsible, and giving a little more room for settings labels.

Note: This module is not compatible with the *Tidy UI - Game Settings* module. *Tidy UI - Game Settings* already provides equivalents to all of the functionality this module provides, and more. If you want the other features *Tidy UI - Game Settings* provides, use that module instead. If you want just the few features this module provides without any of the other changes *Tidy UI - Game Settings* includes, use this module only.
